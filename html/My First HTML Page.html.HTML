    <p>RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner, operated by the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Star_Line">White Star Line</a>,
      which sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage
      Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making it the deadliest
      sinking of a single ship up to that time. It remains the deadliest peacetime sinking of an ocean liner or cruise
      ship.
      from Southampton, England, to New York City, United States. </p>

    second of three Olympic-
    class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. She was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast.
    Thomas Andrews, the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster. Titanic was under the
    command of Captain Edward Smith, who went down with the ship.
    The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from
    Great Britain and Ireland, Scandinavia, and elsewhere throughout Europe, who were seeking a new life in the
    United States and Canada. </p>

      <h2>Backgroundo</h2>

      <p>The name Titanic derives from the Titans of Greek mythology.
        Built in Belfast, Ireland, in what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,
        RMS Titanic was the second of the three Olympic-class ocean liners—the first was RMS Olympic and the third was
        HMHS Britannic.</p>

    <h2>Dimensions and layout</h2>

    <p>Titanic was 882 feet 9 inches (269.06 m) long with a maximum breadth of 92 feet 6 inches (28.19 m).
      Her total height, measured from the base of the keel to the top of the bridge,
      was 104 feet (32 m).She measured 46,329 GRT and 21,831 NRT and with a draught of 34 feet 7 inches
      (10.54 m), she displaced 52,310 tons. All three of the Olympic-class ships had ten decks
      (excluding the top of the officers' quarters), eight of which were for passenger use.</p>

    <h2>Technology</h2>

    <h3>Water, ventilation and heating</h3>

    <p>The ship was equipped with her own waterworks, capable of heating and pumping water to all parts of the
      vessel via a complex network of pipes and valves. The main water H<sub>2</sub>0 supply was taken aboard while
      Titanic was
      in port, but in an emergency, the ship could also distil fresh water from seawater, though this was not
      a straightforward process as the distillation plant quickly became clogged by salt deposits. A network
      of insulated ducts conveyed warm air, driven by electric fans, around the ship, and First Class cabins
      were fitted with additional electric heaters</p>

    <h2>Titanic Poem</h2>

    <h3>The "Titanic" by Katharine Lee Bates</h3>

    <p>As she sped from dawn to gloaming, a palace upon the sea,<br>
      Did the waves from her proud bows foaming whisper what port should be?<br>
      That her maiden voyage was tending to a haven hushed and deep,<br>
      Where after the shock and the rending she should moor at the wharf of sleep?<br>
      Oh, her name shall be tale and token to all the ships that sail,<br>
      How her mighty heart was broken by blow of a crystal flail,<br>
      How in majesty still peerless her helpless head she bowed<br>
      And in light and music, fearless, plunged to her purple shroud.<br>
      Did gleams and dreams half-heeded, while the days so lightly ran,<br>
      Awaken the glory seeded from God in the soul of man?<br>
      For touched with a shining chrism. with love's fine grace imbued.<br>
      Men turned them to heroism as it were but habitude.<br>
      O midnight strange and solemn, when the icebergs stood at gaze,<br>
      Death on one pallid column, to watch our human ways,<br>
      And saw throned Death defeated by a greater lord than he,<br>
      Immortal Life who greeted home-comers from the sea.<br></p>
